//! The BASELINE HARNESS — this is what miners optimize.
//!
//! It wires together the four pieces of a Ditto agent:
//!   1. a local Turso `Store` (embedded SQLite-family DB with native vectors),
//!   2. an `Embedder` (Ollama `embeddinggemma` by default, 768 dims),
//!   3. a chat `Model` (OpenRouter or local Ollama/vLLM),
//!   4. a `chat::Harness` that prepares memory context, exposes memory tools,
//!      runs the agent loop, and (optionally) saves the turn.
//!
//! `run()` translates a wire `protocol::RunRequest` into a harness run and maps
//! the `RunResult` back to a `protocol::RunResponse`.
//!
//! ============================ EXTENSION POINTS ============================
//! Miners improve their score by editing THIS file. On-chain scoring locks the
//! model to `openai/gpt-oss-20b` through the platform inference relay and
//! FORCES it, so the model is not a tuning lever on-chain. The
//! real levers are retrieval quality, memory grounding, and tool-selection /
//! argument accuracy:
//!
//!  * RETRIEVAL / MEMORY — `PrepareRequest` fields `use_composite`,
//!    `long_term_limit`, `short_term_limit`, `candidate_pool_size`, `variant`.
//!    Better recall = better memory-case answers. You can also plug a learned
//!    `WeightPredictor` into `StoreOptions::predictor`.
//!
//!  * TOOLS — `Options::tools`. The baseline ships memory tools only
//!    (`include_memory_tools: true`). Add host `Tool` implementations to give
//!    the agent real capabilities (web search, image gen, ...). Note: the
//!    validator scores tool *selection*, so even stub tools that record intent
//!    are fine for tool-calling cases.
//!
//!  * SYSTEM PROMPT — `PrepareRequest::system_prompt` in `run()`. The wire
//!    request supplies one, but you can prepend/augment it (tool-use policy,
//!    abstention rules, formatting) to nudge correct tool selection.
//!
//!  * MODEL CHOICE — `Baseline::build_model`. Only affects LOCAL practice: swap
//!    the model id, point at a local Ollama model (free, private), or a vLLM
//!    endpoint. On-chain the validator overrides this with the locked
//!    `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, so it is not a scored lever; use it to rehearse against
//!    the reference weights locally.
//!
